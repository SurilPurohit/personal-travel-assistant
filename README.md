The “Personal Travel Assistant” is a state-of-the-art personal travel assistant based 
on the novel idea of LLM agents. It starts with a very simple trigger of taking in a user 
query and then on their own completely taking charge whether it is just suggesting a 
few top travel recommendations to his client (in case our user) or going to the extent 
of checking the weather, booking flights for them and giving a final travel itinerary to 
our end user. This project aims to make travel much simpler and at convenient for 
our end users because till now they had to pay hefty money to travel agents to do 
the same work with a lot of wasted time.
